# SQLServerExercise
Demo JDBC and a Maven project </br>

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc

You may have to edit the POM.xml file in the project if your version  of the JVM is not compatible with the version that my code needs.

Go to https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc </br>
and pick an older version of the JDBC library, then edit that library name in the POM file. </br>
